\section{Abstract} \label{sec:abstract}

Novel district heating and cooling (DHC) systems allow sharing large geothermal resources between buildings by operating a central water loop near ground temperature, coupled to distributed vapor-compression machines that lift the temperature up or down to what the building’s heating or cooling system requires.
Originally designed to capture heat from low-temperature heat sources more efficiently, those systems also provide opportunities for compressor-less cooling.

Using high-fidelity models of buildings, district energy, building-side HVAC and control systems, we are assessing how to improve resilience of buildings during heat waves and power outages, during which we switch the system from normal operation to a resilience mode at low power.

The sensitivity of the overall system performance in the resilience mode is investigated with regards to the district network topology, the configuration of the primary systems (integration of a waterside economizer, auxiliary cooling), the sizing parameters (cooling coil, fans, geothermal borefield) and the control principles.
Furthermore, the positive externality of a design optimized for resilience is evaluated under standard operating conditions to illustrate to what extent the increased first cost at the building level is balanced by a lower average heat rejection from the compressors that yields sizing margins of the central systems, or how the design for low-power resilient conditioning also contributes to reducing the HVAC energy demand over the year at the district scale.

\section{DHC System} \label{sec:dhc}

\subsection{Design Concept} \label{sec:concept}

The system under investigation is a combined heating and cooling system for cold district networks with distributed heat recovery chillers. The main network distributes water near ground temperature, typically between $9$°C and $16$°C. A large central geothermal borefield is used for seasonal heat storage while auxiliary coolers cater for the annual load imbalance where the heat rejection demand often dominates in mixed-use applications.
The potential benefits of such design are numerous.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The compressor lift is optimized on both sides. On the load side, the supply temperature is driven by the reset logic of each building HVAC system, as opposed to the limiting set point among all connected buildings in case of a central plant. On the source side, the heat rejected by cooling dominated buildings contributes to increasing the loop temperature level, which is beneficial to heating dominated buildings, and vice versa. The impact on the chiller or heater efficiency is around $2$\%/K as shown by a simple Carnot efficiency calculation, and corroborated by manufacturer catalog data.

    \item Heat recovery is possible over the whole network, not only between buildings as described before, but because of the ultra-low temperature network, virtually with any source of low-quality heat, such as condenser water used from process cooling or even sewage water as low as 15°C.

    \item Compressor-less cooling opportunities.

    \item Resilience in case of equipment failure.

    \item The low temperature in the main network allows using uninsulated pipes made of polymeric materials, reducing first costs and potentially increasing the heat storage capacity through the thermal coupling with the ground.

\end{enumerate}

Among the main drawbacks, the following must be mentioned.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The design and operation of the energy transfer stations is more critical, and strongly impacted by the network topology. For instance, hydronic unbalances are likely to yield a  chiller trip out of high condenser pressure.

    \item The maintenance costs may increase due to the distributed architecture, although servicing small screw chillers typically requires less specialized skills than large capacity chillers in central plants.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Energy Transfer Station} \label{sec:ets}

The concept behind the energy transfer station (ETS) was first investigated on a mixed-use development project with distributed geothermal borefields \citep{WetterHu2019}.
It relies on heat recovery chillers%
\footnote{Heat recovery chillers are typically built with scroll or screw compressors that are capable of operating at a high condenser leaving temperature (the operating limit observed across various manufacturers lies around 63°C). That makes that equipment suitable for both heating hot water and domestic hot water production. The drawback is that the compressor is operated at a high lift which is detrimental to the efficiency. A potentially more efficient design is proposed in \cite{Cline2020} where at least two separate units are used and the source-side circuits are connected together with the ambient source (a geothermal borefield in that case), resulting in cascading thermodynamic cycles when the plant operates in simultaneous heating and cooling mode.}
and a load balancing control logic that uses the ambient source---such as the service water through the interface heat exchanger---to drop the excess heat or the excess cold depending on the current operating conditions.

The system schematic is presented Figure~\ref{fig:schematic}, which also includes the design conditions considered for sizing the different components.
We will now summarize the main operating principles. For further details, the reader may refer to the documentation of the model \lstinline|Buildings.Experimental.DHC.EnergyTransferStations.Combined.Generation5.ChillerBorefield| distributed within the Modelica Buildings Library (from the commit \href{https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings/tree/4a6285f}{\lstinline|4a6285f|}).

\begin{itemize}
    \item The supervisory controller ensures the load balancing between the condenser side and the evaporator side of the chiller.

    The temperature at the top of the hot water buffer tank is controlled within a dead band above the supply temperature set point.
    When the temperature reaches the lower limit, cold rejection is activated to create a false load on the evaporator and thus increase the heat transfer rate at the condenser.
    When the temperature reaches the upper limit, heat rejection is activated.

    The maximum signal between heat and cold rejection $u_{Rej}$ is used to control in sequence the optional geothermal borefield (priority system), the district heat exchanger (second priority system), and ultimately the chiller, by resetting down the CHW supply temperature.

    In addition, a controller is used to track the chilled water supply temperature set point at the bottom of the chilled water buffer tank. This controller acts against the ambient source control signal to limit the cold rejection when the set point is not met. This is needed because of the parallel arrangement of the evaporator loop and the ambient loop, where the latter can "steal" primary flow rate that will not reach the buffer tank, which can lead to secondary flow recirculation. This will increase the temperature at the bottom of the tank and creates a demand that will limit the flow rate in the ambient loop. Note that secondary flow recirculation may still happen if the chiller set point (as set by the supervisory controller) is lower than the chilled water supply temperature set point (as set by the building automation system).

    This control logic based on opposing PI controllers was preferred to a discrete logic based on a set of operating modes, where cycling between the different modes was difficult to avoid.

    The only remaining discrete control logic pertains to the actuation of the isolation valves between the condenser and evaporator loops and the ambient loops. Here a simple logic based on the return position of the opposite valve and a non zero heat or cold rejection demand is implemented to open the valve (with additional timers to avoid short cycling).

    \item The district heat exchanger realizes the interface between the building system and the district system.
    It is controlled with the heat or cold rejection signal $u_{Rej}$ yielded by the supervisory controller.
    The primary and secondary circuits are enabled to operate if $u_{Rej}$ is greater than zero and at least one isolation valve is proven open.
    When enabled, the secondary circuit is controlled based on $u_{Rej}$, which is mapped to modulate in sequence the mixing valve and the pump speed. (The mixing valve is needed to stabilize the control of the system when the secondary mass flow rate required to meet the heat or cold rejection demand is below the minimum flow rate to operate the pump.)
    The primary pump speed (or valve opening) is directly modulated with $u_{Rej}$.

    This was preferred to a control based on the temperature due to the variation of the temperature difference between the secondary and primary side when switching between heat rejection (with large temperature difference) and cold rejection (with small temperature difference, as used for sizing). This required gain scheduling and turned out difficult to tune. However, the simpler logic based on the heat or cold rejection demand brings additional requirements regarding hydronic balancing, see §\ref{sec:balancing}.

    \item The optional waterside economizer (WSE) is enabled if there is a cooling demand, and the evaporator isolation valve is closed (i.e., the system is not in cold rejection mode), and the predicted leaving water temperature is lower than the entering water temperature (with additional timers to avoid short cycling). The system is disabled if any of the previous conditions is not met, except that the actual leaving water temperature is used instead of the predicted value.
    When the system is enabled the bypass valve on the secondary side is fully closed and the primary side is controlled so that the primary flow rate varies linearly with the secondary flow rate.

    The waterside economizer is integrated sidestream (on the secondary side) where the CHW temperature is the warmest to maximize the rate of heat transfer at given mass flow rates. However, it is not integrated into the condenser loop because the economizer operates mainly in the shoulder or cold season (with lower cooling loads allowing CHW supply temperature reset and lower service water temperature) when heating loads require a high condenser temperature (higher than the CHW return temperature).

    \item The condenser and evaporator pumps are enabled if there is a cooling or a heating demand (see §\ref{sec:demand}). When enabled, the pumps are operated at constant speed, and the condenser (resp. evaporator) mixing valve is modulated with a PI loop controlling the minimum (resp. maximum) inlet temperature. The chiller is enabled when the pumps are proven on. It is controlled based on the chilled water supply temperature set point yielded by the supervisory controller.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Demand Signal, Supply Temperature Reset and Secondary Pump Control} \label{sec:demand}

The heating and cooling demand signals are computed based on the maximum control signals of the terminal units: whenever a terminal controller yields a non-zero signal (considering a small hysteresis) the demand signal switches to true.

If there is no demand, the secondary pump is disabled, and the supply temperature is reset to the least extreme value, allowing to operate the chiller at low lift.

If there is a demand, the secondary pump is enabled and its speed is modulated with a PI controller tracking a differential pressure set point at the most remote unit%
\footnote{Modern control sequences~\cite{Llp2019} use a cascade control and reset in sequence the differential pressure set point of the distribution pump (up, first) and the CHW supply temperature set point (down, last) when the number of requests yielded by the terminal units increases---giving the priority to maintaining a low compressor lift over a low pump speed---although this sequenced control is
shown to be only slightly better than resetting CHW supply temperature alone.}%
% The above assertion comes from https://www.taylor-engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ASHRAE_Journal_-_Optimizing_Design_Control_of_Chilled_Water_Plants_Part_5_Optimized_Control_Sequences.pdf %
, and the supply temperature is reset with a PI controller tracking the maximum opening of the control valves of the terminal units to match $90\%$.
We noticed that it is important to reset the controller output so that the design set point value is used when the demand signal switches to true. Otherwise there is a significant delay in satisfying the load, followed by a large overshoot, and the control loop is particularly hard to tune.

\subsection{Central Systems}

\subsubsection{Loop Temperature Range} \label{sec:loop_range}

The target range for the supply temperature in the main loop is set at $[9, 16]$°C given the constraints on

\begin{itemize}
    \item the minimum temperature of the fluid leaving the evaporator, which is typically around $3$°C for water without glycol, and the chilled water delta-T, which is set at $4$~K for both the primary and secondary circuits,
    \item the maximum CHW supply temperature in WSE mode compatible with radiant cooling, which is set at $18$°C,
    \item the heat exchanger approach, which is taken equal to $2$~K at design conditions for both the district heat exchanger and the waterside economizer.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Hydronic Network} \label{sec:network}

Uninsulated HDPE pipes are considered, with an hydraulic diameter computed based on a design pressure drop of $250$~Pa/m. A pipe length of $200$~m is considered between each building, as well as a $50$~m long service line.

The main distribution pump is sized considering no load diversity as the actual diversity observed on the load data (see §\ref{sec:buildings}) is close to $100\%$.
The speed of the main distribution pump is modulated with a PI controller tracking a constant pressure differential set point at a remote location. A bypass line is modeled and is sized to recirculate $5\%$ of the design flow rate at the pressure differential set point.


\subsubsection{Geothermal Borefield} \label{sec:geo}

In this paragraph we describe the main characteristics of the ground heat exchanger while providing a first assessment of the number of boreholes based on a conventional sizing method, for both the heating and cooling requirements.
The simulation study will then explore the sizing range in-between those two numbers.
The main question we shall answer is to what extent the size of the borefield can be reduced---adopting a hybrid system design---while still providing enough capacity to maintain the loop supply temperature under an acceptable limit during an extreme week.

\cite{Kavanaugh2014} propose a sizing method where the total borehole length $L$~(m) is given by Equation~\ref{eq:sizing}.

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:geo_sizing}
    L &= \frac{\dot{Q}_a R_{10y} + \dot{Q}_m R_{1m} + \dot{Q}_h \left( R_b + F_{sc} R_{6h} \right)}{\left( T_{Ent} + T_{Lvg} \right) / 2 - \left( T_g + T_p \right)}
\end{align}

with

\begin{avec}
    $\dot{Q}_y$ (W): Net annual average heat transfer to the ground, counted positively for heat rejection to the ground%
    \footnote{This is the opposite convention as the one used in \cite{Kavanaugh2014}, and Equation~\ref{eq:geo_sizing} is rearranged accordingly.}\\
    $R_{10y}$ (m2.K/W): Effective thermal resistance of the ground computed with a 10-year heat pulse \\
    $\dot{Q}_m$ (W): Net monthly average heat transfer to the ground\\
    $R_{1m}$ (m.K/W): Effective thermal resistance of the ground computed with a 1-month heat pulse \\
    $\dot{Q}_h$ (W): Net 6-hour average heat transfer to the ground\\
    $R_b$ (m.K/W): Borehole overall thermal resistance \\
    $F_{sc} = 0.04$ (-): Correction factor for short-circuit heat losses between the upward and downward flowing legs\\
    $R_{6h}$ (m.K/W): Effective thermal resistance of the ground computed with a 6-hour heat pulse \\
    $T_g$ (C): Undisturbed temperature of the ground \\
    $T_p$ (C): Ground temperature penalty \\
    $T_{Ent}$ (C): Temperature of the liquid entering the borefield \\
    $T_{Lvg}$ (C): Temperature of the liquid leaving the borefield \\
\end{avec}

The effective resistances of the ground are computed according to the cylindrical heat source formulation from \cite{Carslaw1947} considering a borehole diameter of $150$~mm, a soil conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density of $2.3$~W/m.K, $1000$~J/kg.K, and $2600$~kg/m3, respectively.
This gives: $R_{10y} = 0.17, R_{1m} = 0.15, R_{6h} = 0.08$~m.K/W.
The overall resistance of the borehole is computed based on the method from \cite{Kavanaugh2014} considering DN40 DR11 HDPE pipes in a double-U configuration and a grout material with a conductivity of $2.0$~W/m.K. This gives: $Rb = 0.06$~m.K/W.
The hourly load data used for sizing are generated as described in §\ref{sec:buildings}, considering a chiller efficiency of $COP_{Cooling} = 7.0$ in cooling mode (with a condenser entering temperature of $18$°C and an evaporator leaving temperature of $7$°C) and $COP_{Heating} = 4.0$ in heating mode (with an evaporator entering temperature of $7$°C and a condenser leaving temperature of $50$°C). This gives the heat flow rate transferred to the main network as presented in Figure~\ref{fig:q_to_ground}.

The sizing rationale is then as follows. Starting from an undisturbed ground temperature of $T_g = 10$°C, the dominating heat rejection will enable reaching an equilibrium temperature of $T_g + T_p = 12.0$°C, which lies roughly in the middle of the target loop temperature range of $[9, 16]$~(C).
From there, the auxiliary cooling system is designed to balance the heat transferred to the main loop on an annual basis, so $Q_y = 0$ is considered to size the borefield. The effect of the auxiliary cooling system on $\dot{Q}_m$ and $\dot{Q}_h$, i.e., near cooling design conditions, is neglected as explained in §\ref{sec:aux_cooling}.
This gives the following number of boreholes considering a borehole depth of $180$~m.

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:geo_sizing_results}
    n_{Heating} &= 705  \\
    n_{Cooling} &= 1426 \nonumber
\end{align}


\begin{figure*}[!htbp]

    \caption{Hourly heat flow rate transferred to the main network (computed from EnergyPlus load data, see §\ref{sec:buildings}).}
    \label{fig:q_to_ground}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{Auxiliary Cooling System} \label{sec:aux_cooling}

The selection of the auxiliary cooling system can be informed by the weather data statistics (see Figure~\ref{fig:weather_stats}) and the contribution of the different heat pulses to the sizing of the borefield based on Equation~\ref{eq:geo_sizing} (see Figure~\ref{fig:contribution_to_L}).

If cooling towers or dry coolers%
\footnote{
Open cooling towers allow approaching the wet bulb temperature up to $2$-$4$~K but require an intermediary heat exchanger to prevent an elevated oxygen concentration in the district loop. They can be operated even at low ambient temperature, under freezing conditions.

Dry coolers allow approaching the dry bulb temperature up to $3$-$4$~K and can be directly connected to the district loop. To avoid the addition of glycol, they shall be enabled only if the ambient temperature is above $0$°C.
% Approach for dry coolers is typically 10K in standard CHW plant design but manufacturers mention an approach up to 3-4K, see https://www.thermaxglobal.com/process-cooling/dry-cooler/ or https://transtherm.co.uk/air-blast-cooler/?ppc_keyword=dry%20air%20cooler&gclid=CjwKCAjw-sqKBhBjEiwAVaQ9a8hpKvRaUDRn4dvGM_c3j2GpLvpW5MQ9KKyJ7JjJUALO8S-Jvv1W9RoCShAQAvD_BwE%
}
are used, they will mainly be off during the hottest months considering the target loop supply temperature of $16$°C.
The auxiliary cooling system will be primarily used during the shoulder seasons to cool down the ground surrounding the borefield, and balance the heat transferred to the main loop on an annual basis.
Considering the annual component from Figure~\ref{fig:contribution_to_L}, the impact on the size of the borefield is limited to about 10\%. Therefore, if the supply temperature must be kept under $16$°C to allow WSE cooling, the highest number of boreholes $n_{Cooling}$ is likely required. This will be verified by modeling auxiliary dry coolers (the benefits of an evaporative system are little in shoulder season operation) that are sized and controlled to balance the heat transferred to the main loop on an annual basis.
Here, a whole-year simulation of the coupled system is needed for a proper sizing. The control sequence is as follows.
The system is enabled based on a similar logic as the one implemented for the waterside economizer, see §\ref{sec:ets}: a predicted leaving water temperature is computed at maximum and minimum fan speed, and  the system is enabled if the temperature at maximum fan speed is lower than the entering temperature (considering a $1$~K margin), and if the temperature at minimum fan speed is higher than the minimum supply temperature set point, and if the ambient temperature is above $0$°C.
When enabled, the fan speed is modulated between its minimum when the entering water temperature equals to the minimum supply temperature set point (considering a $1$~K margin) and its maximum when the entering water temperature equals to the target equilibrium temperature of $12$°C, see §\ref{sec:geo}.
The system is disabled if the actual leaving water temperature is higher than the entering water temperature, or if it is lower than the minimum supply temperature set point.

An alternative hybrid design option relies on auxiliary chillers, that can effectively contribute to lowering the heat rejection demand during the hottest months. In that case, the borefield can likely be downsized to the lowest number of boreholes $n_{Heating}$.
An additional simulation experiment will be carried out to assess to what extent and with what control strategy such a configuration can provide compressor-less cooling capacity during an extreme week, i.e., keep the supply temperature of the loop under $16$°C during the whole week without enabling the chillers. This configuration is not exclusive from the previous one and dry coolers may be used as condenser water coolers, with a waterside economizer option to directly cool down the main loop at low ambient temperature.

\section{Application to a Resilient Operating Mode} \label{sec:application}

\subsection{Description of the Simulation Experiment} \label{sec:experiment}

\subsubsection{Building Models} \label{sec:buildings}

The original building models are taken from the \href{https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/commercial-reference-buildings}{US DOE commercial reference buildings database} and represent new constructions (year 2004) of a medium office, a mid-rise apartment, and a hospital in Chicago IL, USA.
The study focuses on the office building type where resilience metrics are computed based on proxy variables for thermal comfort. The other building types are included to model the load diversity of a typical mixed-use development project.
A multiplier factor of $10$ is applied to the office and apartment types to represent a cluster of similar buildings.
The building models are used in two different ways.

First, simulating those models with EnergyPlus provides heating and cooling load data---the domestic hot water (DHW) loads are not considered in this study---which are used to size the systems.
The resulting building loads are presented Figure~\ref{fig:loads}, the total peak cooling and heating loads are $3.5$ and $3.2$~MW, respectively, and the annual energy is $8.9$ and $5.8$~GWh/y, for a total conditioned floor area of $103,590$~m2.
For the apartment and hospital types, the corresponding time series are then directly used as inputs to the model of the DHC system.
Here, the boundary of the Modelica model is the load side of the ETS component where the building loads are converted into a mass flow rate and temperature variation with an interface component approximating the emission/flow rate characteristic of the building HVAC system.

Second, for the office type, the EnergyPlus input data file is consumed to generate an FMU for Model Exchange that can be coupled to a Modelica model using the Spawn of EnergyPlus toolchain \cite{Wetter2020}. Here, the boundary of the Modelica model encompasses the building HVAC system as well as the air volume of the rooms, while the building envelope is modeled with EnergyPlus.
The building HVAC system is a variable air volume (VAV) system with hot water reheat.
The system components are sized based on the peak loads computed with EnergyPlus (with a cooling load diversity factor of $0.7$) and the requirements from \cite{ASHRAE62.1} for ventilation parameters and from \cite{ASHRAE90.1} for other limiting operating conditions.
The control sequence is adapted from \cite{ASHRAE2006}.
The main features of the implementation are described in \cite{Wetter2022}, and some refactoring was carried out mainly for scalability (with $15$ conditioned zones plus $3$ plenum zones where the air return inlets are located) and to expose all sizing parameters in a central parameter record. However, some limitations from the original model pertain and call for caution and consolidation efforts for large multi-zone applications, namely: the model represents a single supply fan system with no return fan; the parametrization of the duct network is representative of a non-ducted return systems; there is no space static pressure control (unrealistic pressure values are indeed observed at high flow rate and low exhaust damper opening); the fan and motor efficiency is constant.

    \caption{Building loads computed with EnergyPlus, integrated over the year, including the multiplier factors used to represent clusters of similar buildings (DHW loads are presented for reference but are not considered in this study).}
    \label{fig:loads}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{Resilience Scenario and Metrics} \label{sec:resilience}

\paragraph{Weather Data} \label{par:weather}

The weather data for annual simulation is a typical meteorological year (TMY3) for Chicago, IL, USA.
A so-called "resilience design day" is generated based on the most severe conditions in July from that TMY3 weather file, which happen to be more conservative than a design day generated based on the method proposed in \cite{ASHRAE2017} Chapter 14 considering the annual $0.4\%$ design dry-bulb temperature and the mean coincident wet-bulb temperature.
During the resilience design day the dry-bulb temperature range is $[23.3, 35.0]$~(C), the wet-bulb temperature range is $[22.5, 26.9]$~(C), and the global horizontal irradiance peaks at $931$~W/m2.
The resilience design day is repeated $7$ times during the month of July to generate a "resilience design week" over which the comfort analysis is performed.

\paragraph{Internal Heat Gains} \label{par:heatgains}

The nominal heat gains from the original EnergyPlus input data file are corrected to account for an adaptive scenario%
\footnote{This assumption differs from \cite{Mathew2021} where only the loss of the HVAC system is considered without any concomitant reduction in the internal heat gains.}
during the extreme week where the office building operates on backup power. The nominal number of people and plug power is reduced by $30\%$, the nominal lighting power is reduced by $70\%$, and no heat gains from the elevators and domestic hot water system are considered.

\paragraph{Resilience Metrics} \label{par:metrics}

The key metrics and the methodology to gauge the resilience of the office building during the extreme week are taken from \cite{Mathew2021}.
The number of degree-hours beyond a tolerability threshold ($30$°C) is first computed for each thermal zone%
\footnote{For the sake of simplicity, we use here the operative temperature, as opposed to the standard effective temperature in \cite{Mathew2021}.}.
The referenced study then considers that the zone cannot be occupied if that number exceeds $34$~K.h per day while the temperature is still beyond tolerable. This contributes to increasing a so-called number of occupant hours lost (OHL) by the nominal number of people in the zone.
This never happens in our case study, i.e., the number of OHL is always zero for all thermal zones.
For that reason, our analysis is only based on the number of degree-hours above tolerable. In addition, we only consider typical operating hours from $7$am to $7$pm, from Monday to Friday.


\subsection{Results} \label{sec:results}

This section first presents the analysis of the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) that can be achieved during the extreme week considering the district loop target temperature range of $[9, 16]$~(C) and the sensitivity to various sizing parameters of the building HVAC system.
We will then discuss the characteristics and sizing of the central components of the DHC system that are required to respect that temperature range.


\subsubsection{Indoor Environmental Quality in a Compressor-Less Operating Mode} \label{sec:ieq}

Disabling the chillers and relying only on WSE cooling during the extreme week with a service supply temperature of $16$°C does not yield any occupant hours lost in the office building.
The evolution of the operative temperature is provided Figure~\ref{fig:tope}, together with the power drawn by the fans, pumps and chillers, and the total cooling heat flow rate. The case with WSE cooling is compared with the base case with chiller cooling.
The WSE mode yields a reduction of about $60\%$ in the total power at the peak, while still meeting $70\%$ of the load.
This is achieved despite a high chiller $COP$ close to $7$ in the base case.
The significant fan power results from sizing the system air flow rate based on the peak loads and a design coil leaving air temperature of $13$°C, with a diversity factor of $70\%$. This leads to a design air flow rate of $44478$~m3/h, and an air change rate ranging from $3$ to $9$~h-1 among the conditioned zones. Downsizing the system air flow rate by means of a lower design coil leaving air temperature would be beneficial to the fan power but detrimental to the IEQ in the WSE cooling mode.
During the operating hours the average building HVAC system $COP$ (accounting for the AHU fan, the primary and secondary pumps, and the chiller) is equal to $5.2$ in the case of chiller cooling and $7.3$ in the case of WSE cooling, i.e., an increase of $40\%$ in the system efficiency due the WSE mode.

The number of degree-hours above tolerable is presented Figure~\ref{fig:coil} for each of the $15$ thermal zones. Without oversizing the cooling coil (i.e., with a sizing coefficient of $1.0$), the number of degree-hours is below $6$~K.h in the limiting zone during the limiting day%
\footnote{%
\cite{Mathew2021} suggests a limit of $34$~K.h per day to decide that a zone cannot be occupied and to start incrementing the thermal OHL count.}, while the median value remains equal to zero, meaning that a tolerable IEQ can be achieved in a low-power mode in the majority of the thermal zones.

\paragraph{Cooling Coil Sizing} \label{par:cooling_coil}

The sensitivity to the cooling coil capacity is analyzed by applying a multiplier factor to the design $UA$-value of the coil model,  considering that the design pressure drop is increased by the same factor for both the air and the chilled water side. The CHW pump design flow rate is considered identical in all cases.
Our premise is that the integration into an existing system can be made without modifying the CHW distribution pump, provided that sizing margins are available on the pump head (which is typically the case).

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:coil}, oversizing the coil by a factor $1.6$ reduces the number of degree-hours above tolerable by a factor $2$ for the limiting zone, while the average power during the operating hours is increased by about $30\%$ and the total cooling heat flow rate is increased by less than $15\%$, which corresponds to a diminution in the system $COP$ from $7.3$ to $6.4$.

\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Fan Sizing} \label{par:fan}

The sensitivity to the fan sizing is analyzed by applying a multiplier factor $k$ to the nominal volume flow rate and $k^2$ to the nominal head of the fan. The flow resistance of the duct network and all other AHU components is  considered  identical  in  all  cases.
Our premise is that the integration into an existing system can be made by only changing the AHU fan.

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fan}, oversizing the fan has a limited impact on the number of degree-hours above tolerable. Beyond a $20\%$ oversizing factor, the impact is even detrimental. This is because the power drawn by the fan motor scales cubic with the sizing factor, and so does the dissipated heat flow rate. This leads to an increase in the supply air temperature that is no more compensated by the increased air flow rate.
Comparing the base case (sizing factor equal to $1.0$) with the optimum case (sizing factor equal to $1.2$), the average power during the operating hours is increased by about $60\%$ while the total cooling heat flow rate is increased by less than $10\%$, which corresponds to a diminution in the system $COP$ from $7.3$ to $4.8$. The latter value indicates that the WSE cooling mode is then less efficient than the chiller cooling mode.

Comment on the load diversity factor of $70\%$ used for sizing:
$1.4 * 0.7 \approx 1$ and indeed all terminal boxes reach a coincident $100\%$ demand in WSE cooling mode.

Add results fixed design pressure drops (oversizing of the whole air system, namely the coil face area and the ducts).

\paragraph{Geothermal Borefield and Dry Coolers}

The sensitivity to the size of the borefield is illustrated Figure~\ref{fig:geo_sizing_tsup} and Figure~\ref{fig:geo_sizing_energy} by plotting the supply temperature and the transferred energy as computed by simulating five years of operation for different numbers of boreholes within the range given by Equation~\ref{eq:geo_sizing_results}.
Figure~\ref{fig:geo_sizing_energy} shows that the energy transferred to the ground is closed to balanced on an annual basis and that the five year horizon can be used to analyze the operation.
We verify that the initial sizing based on Equation~\ref{eq:geo_sizing} is valid for that hybrid system with auxiliary dry coolers, and that the maximum number of boreholes is indeed required to maintain the supply temperature below $16$°C%
\footnote{%
The temperature variations below the limit of $9$°C are due to the timers used in the control sequence for the dry coolers and could be eliminated is needed.}.
The corresponding sizing ratio is $75$~m/kW (total length of boreholes divided by the system capacity) which lies far outside the range of $[10, 30]$~(m/kW) observed on conventional systems \citep{Kavanaugh2014}. This is explained by the low temperature approach of about $6$~K that is required here for the ground heat exchanger, as opposed to the range of $[10, 25]$~(C) generally used for conventional geothermal systems without any requirement for compressor-less cooling.
This yields a first cost of the geothermal system that is likely prohibitive and rather calls for exploring a hybrid design with the minimum number of boreholes and auxiliary chillers.


\paragraph{Geothermal Borefield and Central Chiller Plant}

considering that an auxiliary cooling system is still needed to balance the load on an annual basis.
In the base case, dry coolers (capacity? approach?) are used for that intent. They are mainly operated in the shoulder seasons as illustrated Figure~\ref{fig:coolers_tsup}.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:concl}

We considered an all-air system as it is the most widely used in the US and the least favorable for high-temperature cooling (as opposed to radiant cooling systems for instance).
This help demonstrate how novel DHC technologies can be deployed to existing buildings and that compressor-less cooling opportunities are accessible to typical air-based systems, providing proper sizing adjustments.

Future studies should investigate the benefits of source-side to source-side connection (indirect heat recovery at lower lift) as opposed to direct heat recovery at higher lift.

    \section{Modeling Hydronic Systems} \label{sec:balancing}

When integrating the ETS model into the whole DHC system model, significant effects of hydronic imbalance were first observed, with the remote ETSs being starved and unable to meet the supply temperature set point, and the ETSs closer to the pump operating at higher flow rates than design.
In addition, convergence issues of the Newton solver appeared, mainly related to the waterside economizer operation.

The first effect was certainly expected using a pressure-driven model of the hydronic system, with no specific care for balancing the connected units. However, and as in real systems, that effect was not expected to disturb the operation to the extent that was observed. Indeed, a controller---controlling for instance a supply temperature or a temperature difference---should limit the primary flow rate under the design values (provided that the primary fluid temperature remains close to the design value). In addition, the heat emission characteristic is supposed to limit the impact of flow shortage, with $50\%$ of the design mass flow rate still providing about $90\%$ of the design heat flow rate for a heat exchanger with $10$ K primary temperature range at design. The only disturbing effects that were expected, and indeed observed, pertain to the low valve authority of the primary control valves that causes control issues, and to the pump speed which is often maxed-out due to the inability to maintain the pressure drop at the remote ETS.

The reason why the ETSs close to the pump often operate at a higher flow rate than design is related to the control based on the heat or cold rejection demand (see §\ref{sec:ets}) that first opens the primary control valve (up to its full opening), then resets down the CHW supply temperature. So the ETSs that are exposed to a higher pressure drop than the design value use the excess flow rate instead of resetting the supply temperature to increase the temperature difference (or rate of heat transfer) with the primary side of the heat exchanger.

Regarding the numerical issues that were encountered we must acknowledge the challenges that remain when modeling closed loop hydronic systems (typically with feedback of a remote differential pressure sensor or of the valve positions to control the main distribution pump).
There has been extensive work that was already carried out to formulate actuator models limiting the size of the DAE systems and exhibiting the proper smoothness required by Newton solvers \cite{Jorissen2015}.
Namely, each actuator model of the Modelica Buildings Library offers the option to solve either for the mass flow rate or for the pressure drop, which breaks the algebraic loop created when two actuators are in parallel or in series, respectively. In addition they provide the option for an additional state variable (mimicking the actuator motion delay) which is another means to avoid an algebraic loop.
In our case, those two modeling features did not solve the convergence issues.

The resolution came from integrating a pressure independent control valve (PICV) into the ETS model to modulate the mass flow rate of the service water through the heat exchangers.
To represent the various technologies of PICVs (dynamic balancing valve in series with a control valve, or built-in flow meter and controller) the model idealizes the physics by solving the simple equation $ \dot{m}_{Act} = u * \dot{m}_{Nom} $, where $u$ is the control signal and $\dot{m}_{Act}$ and $\dot{m}_{Nom}$ are the actual and design mass flow rate, respectively.
The complexity of the model lies in the requirement to properly represent the valve limiting flow characteristics (leakage and full opening) and to compute a pressure drop and a mass flow rate that are continuously differentiable while transitioning between the two characteristics (which is a requirement to apply Newton solvers).
Using that valve model to modulate the service water flow rate offers  key benefits, similar to the ones obtained by the use of PICVs in real hydronic systems.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system is dynamically balanced. The primary flow rate can only marginally exceed the design value. Furthermore, this holds true for any operating point, and any location in the distribution network. To the contrary, balancing valves that are commissioned at design conditions may lead to low pressure differences at the boundaries of the control valves close to the distribution pump in the case of closed loop control based on a remote pressure drop sensor and with low demand on the remote valves.
    \item The controllability is optimal. The relationship between the control signal (varying between $0$ and $1$) and the mass flow rate (varying between close to $0$ and close to the design value) is indeed close to linear. To the contrary, with standard control valves, a potentially large range of flow rate variation (spanning beyond the design value) may be mapped to a limited range of variation of the control signal (depending on the valve authority), leading to tedious controller tuning or control instabilities.
\end{enumerate}

In addition, the simulation model is simplified due to the ideal model of the flow rate control loop, for instance when modeling a waterside economizer where the primary valve position is actuated so that the primary mass flow rate equals the chilled water mass flow rate. This eliminates the need for a controller (and for tuning), while reducing the number of state variables and therefore the time to solution, especially for such control loops with fast pressure-driven dynamics.
