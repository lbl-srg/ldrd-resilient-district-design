Control logic 
Enable with similar logic as WSE: based on predicted leaving water temperature that must be lower (with margin) than entering and higher than minimum leaving temperature. 
When enabled, modulate fan speed between minimum when entering water temperature equals TLvgMin + dTEna, and maximum when entering water temperature equals TEntMax. 
Disable if leaving temperature higher (with margin) than entering or lower than TLvgMin.
